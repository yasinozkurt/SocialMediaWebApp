# SocialMediaWebApp
This repository contains the backend and frontend code of instalarger.com <br>
We created this site to enlarge profile pictures of Instagram users then we added vsco profile picture lookup site. <br>
We got traffic for the vsco profile picture site because, we didn't have opponents for this job. <br>
There are many users in Turkey, Germany, Canada, the USA, and other countries. <br>
To test this application on your computer, you have to install Django, and getuseragent via pip. <br>
This application is our very first project so the code seems a little bit hard to understand. <br>
